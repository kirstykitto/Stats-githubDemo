This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Instructions for this exercise
===

The repo that you have pulled includes:

1. A README file
1. This .Rmd file
1. A dataset (the newStarwars dataset)

Each group (around a table) will modify the first two of these files during this activity. (Remember to leave a commit message so we know what you are changing!)

Your group modifications should add a code chunk to this document that 

1. Updates the group number title below with a heading that explains your approach towards finding correlations 
1. Adds some standard text to explain how you are finding correlation in the newStarwars dataset
1. Includes a statistical analysis using a R function to explore whether there is a correlation between BMI and height
