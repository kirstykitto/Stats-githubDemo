Kirsty is having fun

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Lets go get us a dataset!
```{r}
a=2
b=3
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
starwars
```

Let's add a calculation for BMI
```{r}
starwars %>% mutate(BMI:=mass/((height/100)^2)) -> newStarwars
ggplot(data = newStarwars, mapping = aes(x = mass, y = BMI)) + geom_point()
```

Hmmm... should probably remove the outlier

```{r}
newStarwars %>% filter((BMI<400)) -> newStarwars
ggplot(data = newStarwars, mapping = aes(x = mass, y = BMI)) + geom_point()
```

Hmmmm. Looks not terribly informative... what about BMI vs height?
```{r}
ggplot(data = newStarwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = BMI)) + geom_point()
```


Right... your challenge is to work out if there is a correlation between BMI and height! (And to show evidence of why you think there is/is not using R!)

Instructions
===

The repo that you have pulled includes:

1. A README file
1. This .Rmd file
1. A dataset (the newStarwars dataset)

Each group (around a table) will modify the first two of these files during this activity. (Remember to leave a commit message so we know what you are changing!)

Your group modifications should add a code chunk to this document that 

1. Updates the group number title below with a heading that explains your approach towards finding correlations 
1. Adds some standard text to explain how you are finding correlation in the newStarwars dataset
1. Includes a statistical analysis using a R function to explore whether there is a correlation between BMI and height
